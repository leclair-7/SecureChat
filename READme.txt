usernames and passwords can be found in chatusers.txt

Step 1:
To use this chat application, in the bash terminal, type "javac *.java" to compile the client and the server. Then, open 3 new terminals, in one of the terminals start the server by typing, "java TCPServer".

Step 2:
In another shell login as a client. Type, "java TCPClient" on the shell ( assuming it is a bash shell). You will be prompted to type in a username<s
space>password that already exists on the system. Type in a username and password.

Step 3:
login as a different user using Step 2. 

Step 4:
on the first client, type in a buddy name (case-sensitive), and hit enter. If the buddy whose name the first client, buddy 2, entered is online, then buddy 2 has to type in the name of the first client, then they can chat.
